#Arrays

Storing here to modify arrays for future projects.
This repository mainly consists of projects I engineered with the goal of creating programs that modify arrays to my liking. Simply set the existingArray = [programName].[functionName](parameter1, parameter2,..., parameterN).
These particular programs were inspired by problems I encountered in my university projects as well as those I worked on outside of college that could be solved using array modification.
